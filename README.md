# Zomato-Sentimental-Analysis
This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on Zomato restaurant reviews. It aims to classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral based on the text content.
#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
Zomato is a popular online platform that provides information about restaurants, including user reviews. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify the sentiment of Zomato restaurant reviews. The sentiment labels are divided into three categories: positive, negative, and neutral.

The project involves the following key steps:

Data collection: Obtain a dataset of Zomato restaurant reviews, including text content and sentiment labels.

Data preprocessing: Perform necessary preprocessing steps, such as cleaning the text data, removing stopwords, and normalization

Model development: Train and evaluate different machine learning models for sentiment analysis. Consider various algorithms, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost.

Model evaluation: Assess the performance of the developed models using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Compare the results of AUC Score of different models to determine the best-performing one.

Deployment: Once a satisfactory model is obtained, deploy it in a production environment where it can be used to predict sentiment for new, unseen restaurant reviews.
